## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 11 or later)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (for building the project)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (version 5.7 or later)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/demoSelect.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd demoSelect
   ```

## Configuration
The application is configured using `application.properties`. Open the file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the following properties according to your setup:

```properties
spring.application.name=demoSelect
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/database_name
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=database_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
```

### Database Configuration
- Replace `database_name` with the name of your MySQL database.
- Replace `database_password` with your MySQL user password (default is usually `root`).

## Database Setup
1. Open your MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench.
2. Create the database if it does not exist:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   ```
3. Create the `tbl_users` table by running the following SQL command:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE tbl_users (
       UserId BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       first_name VARCHAR(100),
       email VARCHAR(100)
   );
   ```

## Running the Application
1. Make sure MySQL is running on your machine.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Build and run the application using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Once the application starts successfully, you should see output indicating it is running.

## Endpoints
- **GET /users/{id}** - Retrieve a user by ID.
